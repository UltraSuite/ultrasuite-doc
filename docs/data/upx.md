**<u>Additional data</u>**

| Data type      | Description                                                  |

| slt_labels     | manual annotation from SLT, when available. See [2] for details |
| speaker_labels | speaker diarization identifying therapist (SLT) and child (CHILD) speech |
| word_labels    | automatic word-level alignment                               |
| phone_labels   | automatic phone-level alignment                              |

Labels are available in Praat's TextGrid format and HTK's lab format.

Speaker, word, and phone labels were generated according to the methods described in [4].



### File IDs

Individual recordings are indexed for each session according to their recording times.
See the prompt text file for recording date/time. 

Each file ID also includes a prompt type identifier. See [Data](data.md) for details.

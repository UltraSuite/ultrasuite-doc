# The Ultrax 2020 Dataset - UX2020

**A dataset of ultrasound and audio recorded with children with speech sound disorders**

The Ultrax 2020 dataset is a collection of ultrasound tongue imaging 
and audio data, gathered from children with speech sound disorders
by speech and language therapists in hospital environments.

### Speakers

We recorded data with 43 English-speaking children, but only 37 gave consent to share their data.
These are 11 female speakers and 26 male, aged 5-12 years.
